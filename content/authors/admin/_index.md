I am a fourth year PhD student in the [Data Analytics Lab](http://da.inf.ethz.ch/index.php) at ETH Zurich. Currently, I'm working on natural language processing and non-convex optimization.

Prior to this, I obtained a Master’s degree from ETH in Computer Science and a Bachelor’s degree from KIT Karlsruhe in electrical engineering. 

A copy of my CV can be found [here](cv.pdf).
